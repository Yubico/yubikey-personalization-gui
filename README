	* Programming the YubiKey in "Yubico OTP" mode
	* Programming the YubiKey in "OATH-HOTP" mode
	* Programming the YubiKey in "Static Password" mode
	* Programming the YubiKey in "Challenge-Response" mode
	* Checking type and firmware version of the YubiKey

There are three files "YKPersonalization.pro.user.win", "YKPersonalization.pro.user.lin" and "YKPersonalization.pro.user.mac", one for each of Windows, Linux and MAC platforms that are supported by the tool. Depending upon your platform, rename the corresponding file to "YKPersonalization.pro.user".
